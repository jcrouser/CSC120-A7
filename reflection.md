This assignment sounded a lot worse than it was. Once I understood how to get the attributes to transfer over to the other class, making the methods was semi-easy. It also made it way easier to make the methods. There were still some hiccups along the way(like I didn't fully understand how to make the restock method), but overall everything was doable. I would definitely advise anyone doing this assignment to read the descriptions in the README. I always read them and it helps me know exactly what to do if I know the parameters and output I'm looking for.
