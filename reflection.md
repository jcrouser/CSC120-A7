- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

  Similarly to aggregation, inheritance really streamlines my programming. I noticed this specifically when coding the class constructors for the subclasses House, Library, and Cafe. Because I was able to call the constructor from the super class, Building, the constructors for each of these subclasses was much less complicated. It's also helpful to have all the accessors for the inherited fields name, address, and nFloors in the superclass so those can be omitted from the code for the subclasses.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

  My advice for someone taking this course in the future would be to take advantage of online resources. If you run into a problem in your code, there is a good chance somebody else out there has had the same problem and you will be able to find a solution. You can also sometimes find an abundance of solutions for the same problem so you can pick which one makes the most sense for your code. The number of options out there makes coding feel like a creative outlet! Also, we aren't able to go over a ton of syntax in class so its super helpful to use other sources to help you. I wanted a better way to display the information stored in the Library class's collection than just calling the toString() method from the Hashtable class. I looked up how to display elements in a Hashtable and found a method that made sense to me for my code. With the  method I chose, I was able to display a title's availability as "Available" or "Not available" instead of just "true" or "false".
